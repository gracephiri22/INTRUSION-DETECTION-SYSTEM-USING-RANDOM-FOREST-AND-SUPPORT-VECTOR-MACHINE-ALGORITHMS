# INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-RANDOM-FOREST-AND-SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINE-ALGORITHMS
üìå Project Overview
This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor, analyze, and classify network traffic in order to detect malicious activities and cyberattacks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the system is able to accurately distinguish between normal traffic and a wide range of intrusion attempts, such as denial-of-service (DoS), probe attacks, user-to-root (U2R), and remote-to-local (R2L) attacks.

‚öôÔ∏è What the System Does

Collects and processes network traffic data (CIC-IDS 2017 dataset).

Uses feature selection and preprocessing to improve detection performance.

Trains two powerful models (RF and SVM) to classify traffic into benign or attack categories.

Provides comparative analysis of both algorithms to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Generates results that can be used for real-time intrusion detection in modern cybersecurity infrastructures.

üöÄ Why This Project is Important

Early Threat Detection: Helps organizations detect cyberattacks before they cause severe damage.

Improves Network Security: Enhances the ability of security teams to protect sensitive systems and data.

Reduces False Alarms: Random Forest and SVM provide high accuracy and low false positive rates, making detection more reliable.

Scalability: Can be integrated into larger security frameworks (e.g., firewalls, SIEM systems) to strengthen overall cyber defense.

Research Contribution: Demonstrates how classical ML algorithms (RF, SVM) can still perform strongly against modern attacks when trained with updated datasets like CIC-IDS 2017.

üë• Who Can Benefit

Network administrators: To monitor traffic and quickly respond to threats.

Organizations & businesses: To safeguard IT infrastructure and minimize risks of cyberattacks.

Cybersecurity researchers & students: To explore how ML models can be applied in practical IDS implementations.
